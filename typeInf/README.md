# Project 4 - Type Inference Prolog - Progamming Language Concepts

# Creators: Dhruv Patel and Jonathan Huang

Summary: The way that we approached this project was taking a look at the video lectures that Professor Dobra created on the project and its specs, as well as reading the documentation on Prolog online as well as from the links provided in the README file for the project. We started by taking a look at how the code provided worked. We first looked at what infer did, and how it took in a bunch of Statements in the form of a variable called 'Code'. We saw that the typeCode function recursively called the statements in the Code list one by one and evaluated them accordingly. This was a similar process as the last project, where there was a list of statments, and then each statement had expressions. Once we understood the incremental process from top level of 'infer' to the lower level of evaluating 'typeExp', we took a look at the tests that were written and what they produced. Once understanding this, we started writing unti tests for the lower level functions to make sure they worked, and did as the README advised, by practicing Test Driven Development. Once writing all the tests for low level functions, we wrote the tests for 'typeStatement', and then finally for 'infer'
